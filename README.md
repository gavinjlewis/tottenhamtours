# First Site

Proto site that will hopefully go live fairly soon. I'm in the process of learning
  * Flexbox for CSS
  * JavaScript
  * @media queries
  * GitHub
  * Github Desktop
  * TextMate
  * Terminal
  
...not to mention still being pretty new to HTML5 and CSS.

oh, and Markdown

I'm hanging it all on HTML5 Boilerplate v6.1.0
